Personal Project in C++ Summer 2020

This is a project I started just to give myself some more experience with the object-oriented programming language C++.
Since it's widely used in modern systems, including the video game industry.
After my experiences in Java and C#, I figured it would be good for my portfolio to have something in C++.

The idea of this project is a cross between Bungie's Destiny 2 as well as King's Candy Crush franchises, using the Engrams from D2
and basic match-3 mechanics of many mobile games. All conceptual designs go to their respective owners. I do not own the Engram object
designs in any way, shape, or form.

This entire program started as a joke of a conversation between a group of friends. At first I didn't really take seriously, 
but as I thought about it more began to formulate ideas as to possible implementations for it.
Special thanks to a Mr. A. Dubois for the inspiration for this project which I could use as my C++ portfolio addition.

At the time of this writing, I do not know how far I will be taking this project, nor as to what extent I will end up completing this
program. However, I do hope to at least pay tribute to the original concept.
